Test task-project Blog. I developed an API in Laravel where I can delete, get all information, create and update posts. I also created an output that populates the users and posts tables with dummy data so you can see the pagination. On the client side, I used Bootstrap and made Ajax calls to the API to perform actions on the posts without rendering the page. You can also go to the post details. If you own a post, you can edit and delete it. If not, you will not have access to these functions and buttons. For convenience, I've added a Postman collection with the queries I've used.
