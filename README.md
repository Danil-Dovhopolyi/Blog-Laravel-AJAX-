Test task-project Blog. In it, I developed an API in Laravel, where I can delete, get all the information, create, and update posts. I also made seeds that fill the user and post tables with fake data so that you can see the pagination. On the client-server, I used Bootstrap and made Ajax calls to API to perform actions with posts without rendering the page. Also, you can go to the post details. If you are the post owner, you can edit and delete it. If not, you will not have access to these functions and buttons.
